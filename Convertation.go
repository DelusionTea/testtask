	//Romance rules:

	//I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000
	//
	//Example : XLVII = XL (40 = 50-10) + V (5)  +II(2)
	//
	//!!!!number worthwhile on the right(that is from which it is deducated)
	//Should be no more than what is multiplied by ten!!!
	//----example:
	// 99!=IC   99 ==XCIX
	// 49!-IL   49 == LXIX
	//
	//!!!It is imposible to repeat 4 digits in a row. That is the number 40 cannot be recorded as XXXX, only as LX.
	// Of all these rules, it follows that the max number that can be recorded by Roman numbers is MMMCMXCIX = 3999

	//need counter of digits in a row
